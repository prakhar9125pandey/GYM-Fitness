		<h2>Health & Fitness</h2>
		<p>A healthy and fit person is the one when he/she can function well physically as well as mentally. Proper health and fitness do not depend on our own but also on our physical environment and the quality of food intake. 
			Health and fitness is the most important aspect of our life. There is nothing more important than health for any human being.</p>

		<p>Health & Fitness Guide
			Walking, lifting weights, doing chores – it’s all good.
			Regardless of what you do, regular exercise and physical activity is the path to health and well-being. 
			Exercise burns fat, builds muscle, lowers cholesterol, eases stress and anxiety, lets us sleep restfully. In this guide, we match resources to your exercise needs -- at every fitness level.</p>
		
			 <h2>Here are a few tips to start making health and
				fitness a lifestyle today:</h2>
			<h3>1. FIND EXERCISE YOU ENJOY</h3>
			<p>his is important when it comes to staying consistent with your workouts.
				If you are continually doing exercises you don't enjoy,
				 and they leave you feeling drained physically and emotionally, it’s only going to last so long. 
				 You are better off finding exercises that make you feel good, and you can stick to long term, even if it's not the most intense. Consistent low-intensity exercise will always triumph inconsistent high-intensity exercise. </p>
	
			
			<h3>2.BE PATIENT WHEN IT COMES TO REACHING YOUR PHYSICAL GOALS></h3>
			<p>Remember, results take time. Be easy on yourself.
				Nothing good comes easy. Learn to fall in love with the process and the person
				you become throughout the journey.</p>
			<h3>3. DON’T GIVE UP THE FOODS YOU LOVE</h3>
			<p>I'm a firm believer in never giving up the foods
				you love. Find a way to make your favorite foods healthier. If pizza is your
				favorite food, don't give it up. This will leave you feeling deprived. Get
				creative and use clean ingredients to make your healthy version.</p>
			<h3>4. DON’T COMPETE WITH ANYONE</h3>
			<p>This is your life and your journey. No two people
				are the same, so you should never compare yourself to others. As long as you
				wake up every day and try to be better than you were yesterday, you are on the
				right track.</p>
			<h3>5. TRY NEW THINGS</h3>
			<p>Step out of your comfort zone. Try a new fitness class with a friend and explore different foods.
				Grocery shopping based on what's in season is an easy way to begin experimenting with different foods and exposing yourself to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. If you have never meal prepped before, try it out! Stepping out of your comfort zone and switching things up will keep things interesting and help you stay motivated and inspired to make this way of living a permanent lifestyle.</p>
